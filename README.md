# Driftless Todo | A Minimalist Task Manager

## 📝 Project Description

**Driftless Todo** is a **minimalist and fully functional To-Do List application** built for distraction-free task management. The app's design is focused on a clean, modern user interface (UI) to help users stay focused.

This project serves as a robust **frontend practice project** demonstrating proficiency in React component development, secure state management with **TypeScript**, and structured styling with SCSS.

The core features include:
* Adding new tasks to the list.
* Toggling tasks as completed/active.
* **Filtering** tasks by **All, Active, or Completed** status.
* Clearing all completed tasks at once.
* Displaying a counter for active items remaining.

## 🔗 Live Demo

The application is hosted and publicly available at:

**https://handset-hub.vercel.app/**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is built using a modern and type-safe frontend stack:

* **React** - For efficient component-based UI development.
* **TypeScript** - Ensures type safety, improving code quality and maintainability.
* **SCSS (Sass)** - For structured and modular styling.
* **HTML5 / CSS3**
